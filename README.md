## ðŸ’¡ Why TryTennis?

Tennis isn't just about hitting the ball â€” it's about consistency, body memory, and feedback. For new players, lessons can be expensive and inconsistent. TryTennis bridges that gap by providing:

- Affordable, on-demand skill guidance.
- Visual and haptic feedback without needing a coach during self-play.
- A safe practice environment for beginners to build confidence.
